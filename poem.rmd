Her skin is white cloth,  
 and sheâ€™s all sewn apart  
 and she has many colored pins  
 sticking out of her heart.  
 She has a beautiful set  
 of hypno-disk eyes,  
 the ones that she uses  
 to hypnotize guys.  
 She has many different zombies  
 who are deeply in her trance.  
 She even has a zombie  
 who was originally from France.  
 But she knows she has a curse on her,  
 a curse she cannot win.  
 For if someone gets  
 too close to her,  
 the pins stick farther in.
